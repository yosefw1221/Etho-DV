- ✅ Automatic redirect for non-agent roles
- ✅ Secure API calls with Bearer token

## Navigation Flow

```
/agent (Main Dashboard)
  ├── /agent/bulk-submit (Bulk Upload)
  ├── /agent/forms (Forms Management)
  │     └── /history/{formId} (Form Details - existing)
  └── /agent/analytics (Analytics Dashboard)
```
