# Etho-DV Development Task List

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED**: Basic page structure and UI components  
❌ **PENDING**: All functional features (authentication, forms, database integration)

## Critical Issues to Fix

## Immediate Priority (Next Steps)

1. **Database Models & Connection** - Set up MongoDB and create all necessary schemas
2. **Real Authentication** - Make login/registration actually work with database
3. **Functional Forms** - Make the DV application form actually collect and save data
4. **Agent System** - Create working agent registration and management
5. **File Upload** - Implement actual photo upload functionality

---

## Technical Debt & Improvements

- [ ] Replace placeholder data with real database queries
- [ ] Add proper error handling throughout application
- [ ] Implement proper loading states
- [ ] Add comprehensive form validation
- [ ] Create proper API error responses
- [ ] Add comprehensive logging
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript types for all data models

## Notes

- All current pages are placeholder UI only
- No database integration exists yet
- Authentication is completely non-functional
- Forms don't save any data
- File uploads don't work
- Payment system doesn't exist
- Agent features are UI-only

**Priority: Fix core functionality before adding new features!**
